Log into your IdP admin panel (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)\n2. Create a new SAML application\n3. Set the ACS URL to: https://app.example.com/auth/saml/callback\n4. Set the Entity ID to: https://app.example.com/auth/saml\n5. Configure NameID format as 'emailAddress'\n\nStep 2: Configure Application Settings\n1. Navigate to Settings > Authentication > SSO\n2. Upload your IdP certificate\n3. Enter your IdP's SSO URL\n4. Set the NameID attribute mapping\n5. Test the connection\n\nTroubleshooting:\n- Invalid SAML Response: Check clock synchronization between systems\n- Certificate errors: Ensure certificate is properly formatted and not expired\n- NameID issues: Verify the attribute mapping matches your IdP configuration\n\nFor additional help, contact our Enterprise support team.",

Implement exponential backoff for 429 responses\n2. Monitor rate limit headers to prevent hitting limits\n3. Consider caching responses when possible\n4. Contact support if you need higher limits\n\nBest Practices:\n- Use webhooks instead of polling where available\n- Implement efficient pagination\n- Cache frequently accessed data\n- Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits",
